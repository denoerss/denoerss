# Hello

My name ist Denise Albrecht (she/her). 

## My Work
- I'm a hamburg based designer and artist
- My practice takes a strongly conceptual approach and focuses on the broad field of **visual communication**.
- I'm interested in new infrastructures between different disciplines (such as **digital art**, **education** and **experience design**).
- I work both in freelance solo projects and in close discourse with other creatives and creative studios at the intersection of design, art and culture.
- Recent projects include collaborations with [Kunstverein Bielefeld](https://www.denise-albrecht.de/mirror-montage-wire-mesh) and [Hochschule Bielefeld](https://www.denise-albrecht.de/50-years-of-future).

### Now + Next
As I'm very interested in the possibilities of digital communication, I'm currently completing further training as a web developer @ Neue Fische.
