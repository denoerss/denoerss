## Hello

My name ist _Denise Albrecht_ (she/her). 

# My Work
- I'm a hamburg based designer and artist whose practice takes a strongly conceptual approach and focuses on the broad field of **visual communication**.
- I'm particularly interested in new infrastructures between different disciplines such as **digital art**, **education** and **experience design**.
- I work both in freelance solo projects and in close discourse with other creatives and creative studios at the intersection of design, art and culture.
- Recent projects include collaborations with _[Kunstverein Bielefeld](https://www.denise-albrecht.de/mirror-montage-wire-mesh)_ and _[Hochschule Bielefeld](https://www.denise-albrecht.de/50-years-of-future)_.

# Now + Next
As I'm very interested in the possibilities of digital communication, I'm currently completing further training as a web developer @ _Neue Fische_.
