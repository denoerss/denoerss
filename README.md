## Hello

My name ist Denise Albrecht (she/her). I'm a hamburg based designer and artist whose practice takes a strongly conceptual approach and focuses on the broad field of visual communication. I'm particularly interested in new infrastructures between different disciplines such asdigital art, education and experience design. I work both in freelance solo projects and in close discourse with other creatives and creative studios at the intersection of design, art and culture. Recent projects include collaborations with 'Kunstverein Bielefeld' and 'Hochschule Bielefeld'. As I'm very interested in the possibilities of digital communication, I'm currently completing further training as a web developer @ Neue Fische.
